	-> local/ziyad to remote/ziyad
when im done doing changes on local ziyad and i want to push to
remote ziyad, i should see the changes that have been made on the
remote main branch + nadi chghol bach npushi l local ziyad:


git fetch origin
	-> Now you have the latest version of origin/main available locally,
	but nothing has changed in your local files yet.

git diff origin/main
	-> Compare your local ziyad to the remote main branch.

git log origin/main --oneline --graph
	-> (Optional) ila bghit summary deyal commits

git merge origin/main
	-> This is how you get the latest stable team code into your work.
	-> You might have to resolve conflicts here — but that’s good. It means
	you’re catching them before they hit the main branch.

git push origin ziyad
	-> Now you can push to your remote ziyad.
